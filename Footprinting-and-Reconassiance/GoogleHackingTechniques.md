Open google search engine and just type this. To use google to find if any of the pages from a given site are exposed for credential bruteforcing or injection attacks
```
intitle:login site:eccouncil.org
```

Check if a given filetype is exposed which has the keywords "EC-Council"
```
EC-Council filetype:pdf
```

"related" keyword lists site relevant or similar to a given input
```
related:eccouncil.org
```

"allintitle" can provide index page where pdf files are stored
```
allintitle: index.of "*.pdf"
```
allintitle: index.of ".*pdf"
```

"location" is obvious, the physical location of the queried site
```
location: eccouncil.org
```
